### PhD Student, Systems Engineering
Hi, I'm Tolkien! 

I am a PhD student in the [Department of Systems Engineering](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/sys/) at Cornell University. I work on decision making under uncertainty, game theory, and mechanism design particularly as they apply to climate policy. 

## On robust optimization for climate policy
In decision making under uncertainty we have a function $f:\mathcal{X} \times \mathcal{Y} \to \mathbb{R}$. We have control over one input $x \in \mathcal{X}$ but the other input $y \in \mathcal{Y}$ is u There are two primary approaches to dealing with uncertainty in decision making.
